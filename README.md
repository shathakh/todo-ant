# ToDO with antd
Your task is to create a todo app, using [Ant Design of React](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce)

Take your time to play around with antd components, Don't rush we have the whole day !

Try to play with components using Form, card, notification, message, Date picker, Pop confirm, Button, pagination, and Modal.

- use Antd form in modal to add and edit new todo
- use Date picker to select date for that todo
- use message to alert user with detailed messages
- use confirm before delete any todo
- only display specific number of todos in every page with pagination
